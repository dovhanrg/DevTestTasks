Bonus/Additional features
---

Not essential, but nice to have:

* Some styling.

Some hints/clarifications
---
* It's okay (and might be easier )to simply send GET request to Google/Bing/DuckDuckGo and parse HTML, when searching for images, instead of using the corresponding Image Search API.
* It's good (and encouraged) to use any `npm` packages you can find/think of.
* If something is unclear or you have any additional questions, don't hesitate to submit an issue with your question.
